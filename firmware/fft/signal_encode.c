// Encoding scheme uses two signals, one at 20kHz and the other at 21kHz.
// The 20kHz signal is a clock signal. Data is read at the second consecutive
// rising edge. (I.e. two clock pulses for every data bit.)
//
// Data is transmitted in 8-byte chunks, which includes 1 byte of parity.
//
// Only initial byte can have the value 0xFF. This value is used to signal
// the beginning of a transmission.
//
// The value of the remaining bytes is interpreted literally if between 0 and
// 243 inclusive. If it is 244, then this byte is discarded and 1 is added to
// the value of the next byte.
//
// After each 8-byte chunk is transmitted, the receiver waits for an
// acknowledgement. This is either a parity error acknowledgement or an 'ok'
// acknowledgement with a parity byte for the whole 8-byte chunk (including
// the original parity byte).
