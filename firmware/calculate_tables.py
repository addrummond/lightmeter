# Voltage: from 0 up in 1/256ths of the reference voltage.
# EV: from -5 to 26EV in 1/8 EV intervals.
#
# The table is a 2D array of bytes mapping (temperature, voltage) to
# EV*8.  Temperature goes up in steps of 16 (in terms of the 8-bit
# value).  Voltage goes up in steps of 1 (in terms of the 8-bit
# value).
#
# The resulting table would take up (256/1)*(256/16) = 4096 bytes =
# 4K, which would just about fit in the attiny85's 8K of
# flash. However, to make the table more compact, each row (series of
# voltages) is stored with the first 8-bit value followed by a series
# of (compacted) 1-bit values, where each 1-bit value indicates the
# (always positive) difference with the previous value.
#
# The initial idea was to use the following layout for each row. 16
# groups of three bytes, where the first byte in each group is an
# absolute EV value and the next two bytes give 1-bit
# differences. (For simplicity, the first bit is always 0, i.e., it
# gives the difference of abs_ev with abs_ev+0).  The value of any
# given cell can therefore be determined by doing at most 15
# additions. Each addition takes 1 clock cycle. If we conservatively
# assume 10 cycles for each iteration of the loop, that's 150 cycles,
# which at 8MHz is about 1/150th of a second.
#
# In this layout each row is 48 bytes, meaning that the table as a whole takes
# up a more managable 768 bytes.
#
#             voltage
#               (0)                 (16)
#  temp  (0)    ev  diffs diffs     ev   diffs diffs ...
#        (16)   ev  diffs diffs     ev   diffs diffs ...
#        (32)   ev  diffs diffs     ev   diffs diffs ...
#
# There are only 14 distinct diffs 8-bit patterns. We can therefore
# replace each [diffs diffs] sequence with the sequence [ev i], where
# i is a single byte containing two 4-bit indices (one for each 8-bit
# bit pattern) into an array of 14 bytes. This gives us a table where
# each row is 32 bytes, so together with the 12-byte bit pattern
# array, the entire thing takes up 524 bytes.
#
# Finally, since the array itself now takes up 512 bytes, we can split
# it into two arrays (one for the absolute value bytes and one for the
# diff bit pattern index bytes) so that each separate array can be
# indexed by a single byte.
